# StoringCapacity_HDC
Notebooks with code for measuring the storing capacity of hyperdimensional binary vectors. 

This repository contains 4 notebooks describing a Hyperdimensional Computing system. We present two experiments (located in "Storing_Experiments") to measure the storing capacity of binary vectors. 

This experiments are detailed on a publication to be published.
