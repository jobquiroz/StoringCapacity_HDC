# StoringCapacity_HDC
Notebooks with code for measuring the storing capacity of hyperdimensional binary vectors. 

This repository contains 4 notebooks describing a Hyperdimensional Computing system. We present two experiments (located in "Storing_Experiments") to measure the storing capacity of binary vectors. 

This experiments are detailed on a publication to be published. 

**HDComputing_basics** It implements the fundamental class for a high-dimensional vector. It implements the basic arithmetic and memory operations.

**HDComputing_Tests** Shows some basic operations with HD vectors.

**EncodingDataset** It includes functions to encode concepts based on a set of semantic features. Maps words to vectors.

**Storing_Experiments** This is the most important notebook. It uses the previous ones to set up 2 experiments to measure the storing capability of vectors.
